## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

üí° Note: If you encounter Redis-related errors like connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379, it's likely because Redis isn't running on your Windows machine.

‚úÖ As an alternative, you can start Redis inside WSL/Ubuntu with:

sudo service redis-server start

This is helpful especially if Redis is not available or unstable on your native Windows environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AdarshM18/Chatcode-ai.git
cd Chatcode-ai

# Install dependencies for frontend and backend
cd frontend
npm install
cd ../backend
npm install

# Start the development servers
cd backend
npx nodemon

# In another terminal, start the frontend (Vite dev server)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to create a `.env` file in the backend directory if environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI or API keys) are required.
